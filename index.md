### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was one of my favorite projects to work on because of how simplistic it was. I've played Hi-Lo games before on the internet, but never thought about the programming that went on behind it. We got to implement if statements which I started getting a lot better at in this project.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 3 was another really fun project. My partner and I had some trouble working on it especially with the input file stream. Once we were able to figure it out though, it was really satisfying to see all the animations. It got me thinking that this must have been one way programmers thought of creating moving images before videos were a thing.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was a favorite project because my friends and I like to play Blackjack, and it was interesting for me to program my own version of it. We got to utilize vectors and if statements, and it was overall an easy but fun project. It's really satisfying to have fun using a program I created myself.
